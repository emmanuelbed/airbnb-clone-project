# About the Project
The Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform like Airbnb. It involves a deep dive into full-stack development, focusing on backend systems, database design, API development, and application security. This project enables learners to understand complex architectures, workflows, and collaborative team dynamics while building a scalable web application.

# Learning Objective
This project is tailored to enhance your expertise in modern software development practices. By completing these tasks, learners will:

Master collaborative team workflows using GitHub.
Deepen their understanding of backend architecture and database design principles.
Implement advanced security measures for API development.
Gain proficiency in designing and managing CI/CD pipelines for efficient deployment.
Strengthen their ability to document and plan complex software projects effectively.
Develop an understanding of integrating technologies like Django, MySQL, and GraphQL in a unified ecosystem.

# Technology Stack
Django: A web framework for building RESTful APIs
PostgreSQL:  A free and open-source relational database management system emphasizing extensibility and SQL compliance.
GraphQL: is a data query and manipulation language that allows specifying what data is to be retrieved ("declarative data fetching") or modified.

# Database Design
Users: A user can have multiple Properties
Properties: Each property can have several unique features
Bookings: A booking belongs to a property
Reviews: Each user can give a review with rattings
Payments: Multiple payment gateways integrated for a varity of user choices.
